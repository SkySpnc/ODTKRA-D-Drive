# ODTKRA D
Uses the Oculus Debug Tool to keep your rift from going to sleep for installs located in D:\Oculus

[Forked from this lovey person](https://github.com/DeltaNeverUsed/ODTKRA)

# Instructions
- Download the exe file in releases
- Run exe after starting Touch Link
- Let ODTKRA do its thing and do not touch the Oculus Debug tool, it is supposed to be minimised.
- Your headset will now not go to sleep, if it does, restart ODTKRA.

# Better performance
This is unrelated to the actual app, but is to help remedy performance lost due to Oculus running in the background.
- Raname C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-dash (or in this case D:\Oculus\Support\oculus-dash-shit) to something else. For example, ocusus-dash. This will also stop scren burn in. Doesn't load the 1.2Gb dash into VRAM.
- Disable guardian. Helps stop burn in. Reduces CPU usage every so slightly.
- Move headset out of view from sensors. Reduces CPU usage ever so slightly.
